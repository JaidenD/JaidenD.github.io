               My interests lie in mathematics that is inherently useful.<br>
               In order to have 23rd century technology we must have engineers, biologists, etc... <br>
               who are well acquainted with at least a few volumes of Landau Lifshitz <br>
               and the mathematical formalisms that are associated with their respective field.

                <p style="color: lightblue">
                    Currently my favorite section of any book is from Landau Lifshitz volume 1, namely the first 2 chapters. The first page of chapter 1 starts off 
                    by talking about generalized cordinates: If we have a system of N particles then we need 3N quantities to describe it's position, but just having
                     these quantities isn't enough to calculate the *motion* of the system, for that we need the velocities of each particle. <br>
                     <br>
                     The next section introduces an unnamed function, \(L(q,\dot{q},t)\), the claim is that every system is characterized by such a function, 
                     and that the motion of said system acts in such a way where the following condition involving L is satasfied:

                     $$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q,\dot{q},t) dt$$

                     This integral is known as the action. This integral paints the picture that things move in such a way where the 'effort' is minimal. This idea is
                     obvious to any human too, if you throw something you know it will take some path, and this path depends on a handful of quantities. <br>
                     
                     <br>
                     
                     But how do we get from this integral to a set of differential equations that determine the motion of a system? I.e what path minimizes the action?<br>
                    
                     <br>
                    
                     Lets consider a function \(q(t)\) where S is at a minimum. Since S is at a miniumum, any small variation of the function \(q(t)\) results in an 
                     increase
                     of S. Let \(\delta q(t)\) be some function that is 'small', by that I mean when added to \(q(t)\) it infinitesimally varies the path. <br>

                     The action varies between these two paths by <br>

                     $$ \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q+\delta q,\dot{q} + \delta \dot{q} ,t) dt - \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q,\dot{q},t) dt $$
