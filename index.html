            <p class="me_text"> Hi, I'm Jaiden. <br>
              Currently, I'm a 4th-year mathematics student at Brock University. I'm interested in applying methods from mathematics and theoretical physics to problems in engineering, partly inspired by the work of <a href="https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Robert_Hermann">Robert Hermann</a>.
              <br>
              The majority of my mathematical activity occurs independently; I have studied differential geometry, algebraic topology, classical mechanics/field theory, representation theory, quantum mechanics, etc.
              <br>
              In September I will be doing my master's in electrical engineering doing research in control theory. My goal is to continue Hermann's Interdiciplinary Mathematics program by finding new ways of applying geometry to engineering problems.

          <p href="#">My current research is broadly in applying geometric methods to control. A project currently comign to fruitation is one where I use ideas from Riemannian geometry to design
              path following algorithms. A larger project which I'm very excited about bridges control and PDE symmetries (my undergraduate research topic). In short, in a mechanical system when you impose holonimic constraints
              via control actuation, the resulting dynamics may no longer be lagrangian. But we still wish to find symmetries and have an analog of noethers theorem! This can in fact be done with modern 
              symmetry toold, but the metods are quite unknown to the broader community.
