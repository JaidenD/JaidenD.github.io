            <p class="me_text"> Hi, I'm Jaiden. <br>
              Currently, I'm a 4th-year mathematics student at Brock University. I'm interested in applying methods from mathematics and theoretical physics to problems in engineering, partly inspired by the work of <a href="https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Robert_Hermann">Robert Hermann</a>.
              <br>
              The majority of my mathematical activity occurs independently; I have studied differential geometry, algebraic topology, classical mechanics/field theory, representation theory, quantum mechanics, etc.
              <br>
              I'm currently looking for a graduate advisor! If you're working on applied mathematics (PDEs, fluids, numerics, etc.), or generally if your work relates to the philosophy mentioned in the first paragraph, I would be very interested in working with you!

          <p href="#">Currently, my research involves computing symmetries and conserved quantities of relativistic fluid dynamics. '
            This is a particularly interesting problem because curved space-time requires working in a coordinate-free setting, which forces computations to be carried out by hand. 
            Additionally, pressure functions and relativity individually yield rich symmetries. The hope is that by combining these properties, we will uncover very nice and unexpected symmetries.
